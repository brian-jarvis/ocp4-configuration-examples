        # Cluster Logging
        The Cluster Logging Operator orchestrates and manages the aggregated logging stack as a cluster-wide service.

        ##Features
        * **Create/Destroy**: Launch and create an aggregated logging stack to support the entire OKD cluster.
        * **Simplified Configuration**: Configure your aggregated logging cluster's structure like components and end points easily.

        ## Prerequisites and Requirements
        ### Cluster Logging Namespace
        Cluster logging and the Cluster Logging Operator is only deployable to the **openshift-logging** namespace. This namespace
        must be explicitly created by a cluster administrator (e.g. `oc create ns openshift-logging`). To enable metrics
        service discovery add namespace label `openshift.io/cluster-monitoring: "true"`.
        ### Elasticsearch Operator
        The Elasticsearch Operator is responsible for orchestrating and managing cluster logging's Elasticsearch cluster.  This
        operator must be deployed to the global operator group namespace
        ### Memory Considerations
        Elasticsearch is a memory intensive application.  Cluster Logging will specify that each Elasticsearch node needs
        16G of memory for both request and limit unless otherwise defined in the ClusterLogging custom resource. The initial
        set of OKD nodes may not be large enough to support the Elasticsearch cluster.  Additional OKD nodes must be added
        to the OKD cluster if you desire to run with the recommended(or better) memory. Each ES node can operate with a
        lower memory setting though this is not recommended for production deployments.
