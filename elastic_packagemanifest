          The Elasticsearch Operator for OKD provides a means for configuring and managing an Elasticsearch cluster for tracing and cluster logging.
          ## Prerequisites and Requirements
          ### Elasticsearch Operator Namespace
          The Elasticsearch Operator must be deployed to the global operator group namespace
          ### Memory Considerations
          Elasticsearch is a memory intensive application.  The initial
          set of OKD nodes may not be large enough to support the Elasticsearch cluster.  Additional OKD nodes must be added
          to the OKD cluster if you desire to run with the recommended (or better) memory. Each ES node can operate with a
          lower memory setting though this is not recommended for production deployments.

        The Elasticsearch Operator for OKD provides a means for configuring and managing an Elasticsearch cluster for use in tracing and cluster logging.
        This operator only supports OKD Cluster Logging and Jaeger.  It is tightly coupled to each and is not currently capable of
        being used as a general purpose manager of Elasticsearch clusters running on OKD.

        It is recommended this operator be deployed to the **openshift-operators** namespace to properly support the Cluster Logging and Jaeger use cases.

        Once installed, the operator provides the following features:
        * **Create/Destroy**: Deploy an Elasticsearch cluster to the same namespace in which the Elasticsearch custom resource is created.
